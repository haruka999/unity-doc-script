ReportProgress(string,double,Action<bool>)
</signature>
Reports the progress of an achievement.
The achievement ID number must match an achievement description associated with this application. Reporting a progress of 0.0 usually means the achievement can be shown if it was hidden before. Depending on the platform, partial progress cannot always be reported, in which case 100.0 is the only other value which can be used.
