GetUniqueTempPathInProject()
</signature>
Returns a unique path in the Temp folder within your current project.
The returned path is relative to the project folder.

The returned path is of a form @@Temp/UnityTempFile-@@''uniqueID'', where /uniqueID/ is guaranteed to be
unique over space and time.

You can use it to create temporary files/folders and be sure that
you are not overriding somebody else's files, plus you don't have to
keep track of the unique IDs yourself.
