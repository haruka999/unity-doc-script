LoadAll(string,Type)
</signature>
Loads all assets in a folder or file at /path/ in a Resources folder.
If /path/ refers to a folder, all assets in the folder will be returned.
If /path/ refers to a file, only that asset will be returned.
Only objects of /type/ will be returned.
The /path/ is relative to any Resources folder inside the Assets folder of your project.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX
	// Loads all assets in the "Resources/Textures" folder
	// Then picks a random one from the list.
	// Note: Random.Range in this case returns [low,high)
	// range, i.e. the high value is not inclusive.

	function Start (){
		var go = new GameObject.CreatePrimitive(PrimitiveType.Cube);
		var textures : Object[] = Resources.LoadAll("Textures", Texture2D);
		var texture : Texture2D  = textures[Random.Range(0, textures.Length)];
		go.renderer.material.mainTexture = texture;
	}
