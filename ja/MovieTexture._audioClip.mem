ムービーテクスチャの[[AudioClip]] オブジェクトを返す。
Note that this is a special [[AudioClip]] which will always play its audio synchronized to the movie.
If you attach a Movie's audioClip to a source in the editor, it will start playing automatically when the movie is playing,
Otherwise you'll have to start it manually when you start the movie.
The clip can only be attached to one single [[AudioSource]].
