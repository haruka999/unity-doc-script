親のTransformオブジェクトから見た相対的な位置
If the transform has no parent, it is the same as Transform.position.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX
	// Move the object to the same position as the parent:
	transform.localPosition = Vector3(0, 0, 0);

	// Get the y component of the position relative to the parent
	// and print it to the Console
	print(transform.localPosition.y);
END EX
Note that the parent transform's world rotation and scale are applied to the local position when calculating the world position.
This means that while 1 unit in Transform.position is always 1 unit, 1 unit in Transform.localPosition will get scaled by the scale of all ancestors.
