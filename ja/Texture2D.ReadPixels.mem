スクリーン画面のピクセルデータを読み込む
This will copy a rectangular pixel area from the currently active [[RenderTexture]] or the view (specified by /source/) into the position defined
by /destX/ and /destY/. Both coordinates use pixel space - (0,0) is lower left.

If /recalculateMipMaps/ is set to true, the mip maps of the texture will also be updated. If /recalculateMipMaps/ is set to false, you must call ::ref::Apply to recalculate them.

This function works only on /ARGB32/ and /RGB24/ texture formats.
The texture also has to have __Read/Write Enabled__ flag set in the import settings.
ReadPixels is unsupported on Flash.
